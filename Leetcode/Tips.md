# reverse linked list --> store reverse advance
# DFS traversals 
    - pre order  // node, left, right 
    - in order   // left, node, right
    - post order // left, right, node 

# merging lists into new list 
    - while head, assign currentNode.next = head1
    - then incremenet head1 = head1.next

# Practice BASICS 
      1. Two Sum 
      2. Contains Duplicate
      3. Isomorphic Strings
      4. Valid Anagram
      5. Intersection of Two Arrays
      6. Group Anagrams
      7. Majority Element

# Medium/Hard
      - Sliding window + hashmap (e.g. Minimum Window Substring)
      - Two-pointer variations (e.g. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)
      - Greedy / Heap (e.g. Merge Intervals, Task Scheduler)
      - Dynamic Programming (e.g. House Robber, Partition Equal Subset Sum)
      - String processing (e.g. Valid Parentheses, Decode String)

# Done: 
      1. Two Sum 
      2. Container with Most Water
      3. Valid Parentheses 
      4. Contains Duplicate
      5. Isomorphic Strings 
      6. Valid Anagram
      7. Group Anagrams 
      8. Intersection of Two Arrays 
      9. MajorityElement
      
      10. LongestSubstring 
      11. FindAllAnagrams
      12. Permutation in String

      13. Rotate Image ~
